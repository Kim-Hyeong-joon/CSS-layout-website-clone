            <h1>Rodić Davidson: London Architecture</h1>
            <p>
              Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London
              since 2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of London, we
              have developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often
              Listed and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and
              experience consistently secure Planning Consents, Listed Building
              Consents and Great Estate Licenses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many areas within central London boroughs were originally
              developed by aristocratic families (examples being Grosvenor,
              Cadogan, De Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates
              still own large swathes of, what is now commonly referred to as,
              Prime Central London. These Great Estates maintain significant
              influence either through direct ownership or through various
              stewardship schemes, an example being the Belgrave Estate
              Management Scheme administered by Grosvenor. Schemes such as this
              enable the Estate to exert control over the use, development, and
              appearance of the designated area.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London
              and elsewhere in the UK. Through sensitive, contextual design and
              iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have
              established a track record of obtaining difficult planning
              consents for both new-build and existing properties.
